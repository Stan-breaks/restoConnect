within their financial means, and engage with local eateries in a way that fosters a sense of
community and inclusivity. RestoConnect aims to revolutionize the restaurant industry by
democratizing access to affordable and delicious meals, thereby enhancing the dining experience
for budget-conscious customers and promoting the sustainability of local eateries.
